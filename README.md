# Purpose

The purpose of this Portfolio Website was for me to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS, which was taught during the first semester of my October 2023 Standard Web Development Coding Bootcamp at Coder Academy, and to apply that knowledge in creating a portfolio website to showcase myself to potential employers.

This website will be updated regularly to display my projects that I have been working on, and to display the development of my skills over time as my skills develop further.

# Target Audience

I have created my portfolio website to target future employers who wish to learn more about me, and wish to view how I apply and utilise my skills to create a portfolio website about myself. It will provide any future employer with a solid undertanding of who I am, what my skills are, what projects I have delivered in the past, and what value I can bring to their organisation when considering me for opportunities.

# Tech Stack

This sitemap represents the structure of my website. The home page (home) links to all the other pages of my website through the navigation bar including About Me, My Projects, My Blog, and Contact Me. The navigation bar is on all pages, so that users can navigate to any page at all times. I have placed all 5 individual blog pages within the My Blog page, and each of the individual pages have a back button to navigate back to the My Blog page. 

I have also included a download resume button on my home page, and have included clickable icons on my Contact Me page to direct users to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and to call or email me.

# Functionality and Features

## Key Features

* Responsive design (Flexbox and CSSGrid) across multiple devices which allows it to be accessible for users of mobile phones, tablets and desktop

* Minimalist aesthetic design to display content on each page, supplemented with warm colour of blanchedalmond and white for ease of readability and professionalism

* Easy to navigate across all pages on website through navigation bar and links

* Contact form on Contact Me page for users to send messages (note: backend not developed to receive form responses)

* Use of cards to structure content on pages

* Icons on Contact Me page to link to GitHub, Linked, email, and phone

* Home page contains a background image consisting of a clean vector grid with a floating hero image of me and a short description followed by a download button to download my PDF resume

## Design
* **Mobile-First Design Approach** -  All pages were designed with a smaller screen in mind. Layout was scaled accordingly to acccount for other sizes (ie. tablet and desktop)

* **Font Choice** - I chose the Helvetica font for all pages of the website, as it offered web compatibility across all devices and browsers, whilst also maintaining an aesthetic and minimalist look for website users

* **Colour Theme** - I chose to use a mixture of a plain white background which was supplemented with a blanchedalmond colour used for the cards and navigation bar. This provides a clean, minimalist and aesthetic look for users, whilst also providing ease of reading the content on the pages 

    Additionally, I was influenced to use these two colours as it is the combination of the colours of my two dogs (white and brown). So, I picked the colours as a homage to them, as they were by my side throughout the development of my website

* **Cards** - I utilised cards to display my content for most of my pages as I liked the idea of having my webpages having a modular component to it. This stops the website from looking cluttered, whilst also guiding users on where they should focus to absorb specific content that they're after

## Images

I have used appropriate personal images, where appropriate, across the website. I have included a photo of myself in the Home page, a photo of my dogs in the About Me page, another photo of me in About Me page, and I have reused the image of me from the Home page as the icon to be displayed on the tabs of all my webpages.

For all other images and icons on the website, I have sourced free to use  images either directly from the source (LinkedIn, GitHub), or free to use stock photos from Unsplash and Vecteezy. The images that I chose for the individual pages all link to my personal interests listed in the About Me page.
